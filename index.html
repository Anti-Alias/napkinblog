                I've decided to try my hand at creating a <a href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy</a> game with the intention of sharing it with friends and family
                using the power of the internet! I've toyed with the engine for a few years, but was inspired seeing the numerous game jam submissions on
                <a href="https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-4">itch.io</a>. The site is quite barebones, I'm afraid, but I'm hoping to make a simple playable demo
                within a few weeks.
